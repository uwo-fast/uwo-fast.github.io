## Contributions to Sustainability

FAST contributes to Western's sustainability achievements, focusing on solar photovoltaic technology for sustainable power and open-source hardware for technological empowerment. The group actively engages in projects related to open-source appropriate technologies (OSAT) and distributed recycling and additive manufacturing (DRAM) through RepRap 3-D printing.

## Alignment with Global Sustainability Goals

Western leads in advancing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as evidenced by its top ranking in Canada and third globally in the 2022 Impact Rankings by [Times Higher Education](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/rankings/impact/2022/overall#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/undefined).
